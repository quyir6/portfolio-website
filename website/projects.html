       <h3> Rock Paper Scissors Game </h3>

        <p class="projects-text">
          The first project I created while learing Javascript, HTML, and CSS was a rock paper scissors game. It uses Math.random(); to pick a number between 0-1 and then it sees if that number is less than 1/3, between 1/3 and 2/3, or greater than 2/3. It uses that information to chose rock paper or scissors. It then uses if statements to find out if you win, lose, or tie. Depending if you win, lose, or tie it tells your move, the computer move, and who wins/ties. It then updates your score on the bottom. You are able to use the reset score with a button on the bottom.:
